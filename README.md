# Mayor's Hotline Explorer

Boston's [Mayor's 24-hour Constituent Service](http://www.cityofboston.gov/mayor/24/) allows Boston's citizens a way to engage with the City government to report and track issues that concern them.

The City of Boston and its [Department of Innovation and Technology](http://www.cityofboston.gov/DoIT/) are sponsoring a public hackathon to develop data visualizations from the City's [open data portal](https://data.cityofboston.gov/).

This site, the Mayor's Hotline Explorer provides an interactive visualization of the public records concerning reported incidents.
